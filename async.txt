We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is an asynchronous function. 
The async function returns a promise.

The syntax of async function is:
async function name(parameter1, parameter2, ...paramaterN) {
    // statements
}

The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.
The syntax to use await is:
let result = await promise;
The use of await pauses the async function until the promise returns a result (resolve or reject) value.

The async function allows the asynchronous method to be executed in a seemingly synchronous way. 
Though the operation is asynchronous, it seems that the operation is executed in synchronous manner.
